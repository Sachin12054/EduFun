Make sure these packages are installed in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "~51.0.0",
    "expo-linear-gradient": "~13.0.2",
    "@expo/vector-icons": "^14.0.0",

```

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd edufun-mobile
npm install
```

### Step 2: Configure Firebase
1. Go to Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Create/Select your project
3. Enable Firestore Database
4. Update `src/config/firebase.js` with your credentials:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
export const db = getFirestore(app);
export const auth = getAuth(app);
```

### Step 3: Set Up Firestore Security Rules
In Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /userProgress/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /students/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Initialize User Data
When a student first logs in, their progress document will be automatically created in:
- `userProgress/{userId}`

The structure will include:
- `totalPoints`: 0
- `coins`: 0
- `completedLessons`: []
- `quizResults`: {}
- `badges`: []
- `stickers`: []

### Step 5: Update Navigation
Make sure your `AppNavigator.js` includes the Subject screen:

```javascript
import SubjectScreen from '../screens/SubjectScreen';
import SubjectsScreen from '../screens/SubjectsScreen';

// In your Stack Navigator:
<Stack.Screen name="Subjects" component={SubjectsScreen} />
<Stack.Screen name="Subject" component={SubjectScreen} />
```

## 🎨 Customization Guide

### Adding More Grades (2-5)

Edit `src/data/subjectsData.js`:

```javascript
english: {
  // ... existing grade 1 data
  grades: {
    1: { /* existing */ },
    2: {
      lessons: [
        {
          id: 1,
          title: 'Advanced Grammar 📝',
          content: 'Learn about verbs, adjectives, and more!',
          // ... more fields
        }
      ],
      quizzes: [ /* ... */ ]
    },
    // Add grades 3, 4, 5...
  }
}
```

### Adding New Subjects

```javascript
export const SUBJECTS_DATA = {
  // Existing subjects...
  
  arts: {
    id: 'arts',
    name: 'Arts & Crafts',
    icon: 'palette',
    color: '#FF69B4',
    description: 'Learn drawing and creativity',
    grades: {
      1: {
        lessons: [ /* ... */ ],
        quizzes: [ /* ... */ ]
      }
    }
  }
};
```

export const BADGES = [
  {
    id: 'reading_champion',
    name: 'Reading Champion 📖',
    description: 'Complete 20 English lessons',
    icon: '📖',
    requirement: { type: 'subject_lessons', subject: 'english', count: 20 },
    points: 300
  },
  // Add more badges...
];
```

### Adding More Stickers

```javascript
export const STICKERS = [
  // Existing stickers...
  { id: 11, name: 'Unicorn', emoji: '🦄', rarity: 'legendary' },
  { id: 12, name: 'Pizza', emoji: '🍕', rarity: 'common' },
];
```
